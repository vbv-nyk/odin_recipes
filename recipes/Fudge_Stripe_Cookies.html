<h3>Want to satiate your sweeth tooth?</h3>
<p>Who doesn't like a chocolate striped cookie? These fudge stripe cookies taste just like your childhood Keebler
    favorites - but improved with real chocolate and an all-butter cookie. It is made with a simple sugar cookie dough
    that is very easy to work with and roll out. I used semisweet chocolate to echo the sweeter taste of the Keebler
    originals, but you can of course use any chocolate you like.</p>
